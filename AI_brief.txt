chunked here:
the AI's learn to how to learn through rules and logics that guide them to the desired outcomes.
The algorithms improves and evoles on the results that are desired by the machine or the expert.,
taking cats and dogs as examples they learn through perciving the world and making connections to necessity,pain and pleasure.

But how do machine acheive this goals ?
-> if machine percieves and analyzes what to do based on the stored datas(logics and rules). Then how does it evolve its logic./
How machines learns through situations or teach other machines to learn (meta-learning).

Neural Networks : 
Expressiveness
- Arbitary function approximation
- Perceptron in 1958
- ImageNet 2012.
How the neural networks actually work ?
=> They conclude and simply the complex picture to more simplistically abstract pattern that are interconnected through some relationships(The functions).
It has beat up all other algorithms in image classification(ImageNet 2012). Neural networks tends to footprint the so called biological neural footprint.
deliberate learning : learn about neurons behavour, the sigmoid functions.

-different types of neural neteworks.
